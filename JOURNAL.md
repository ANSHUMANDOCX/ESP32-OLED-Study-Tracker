## 10/21/2025 - Began with researching the parts and finalizing what to use  

I started with researching the components to use with the project how it will. what all it would contain how the webpage will look hosting webpages using esp32 etc.

here are the things finalized

- will be using a 2.42 inch oled display
- ESP32 WROOM module with a onboard programming chip
- TYPE C interface
- like theses ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDE0MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--bca1325a527d93f62e49916bbbf8142001ea9ecf/image.png)
  

## 10/22/2025 8 AM - completed the schematic   

Read datasheets of all the components and completed the schematic.
spent a lot of time deciding the uart ic since there are many good choices finally went with CH343.
also, added 3 buttons for changing subject, start/pause, stop. what it will do is that once stop is pressed it will send the the time to the server and sill be available to see through the web page and the pause will just locally pause the timer.  

also added a auto program logic for the esp32 using transistors.

## 10/22/2025 9 PM - Completed Placing and Routing components on the PCB  

so created a pcb of th size almost similar to the oled display and arranged the components on it.
had to find the exact dimension fo the oled dispaly by goinf through the datasheets.

Also completed the routing of all the components chose to do it on the back side of the pcb and palnning to mount the board directly on the OLED Module using screws to keep the form factor small 

just faced some trouble placing the the screws Holes in proper alignment so that i dont have to modify much after i get the pcb

## 10/23/2025 - Setting up and testing the backend on the esp32  

i tried hosting a webpage on the esp32 with all the feature that i would need. spent the time polishing the website and perfecting those. 
so features i thought of adding-

- a log on the page to keep track of your productive hours
- a target hours options tells one ow much they have been productive and how close they were to their set goal.

here is the website snap
